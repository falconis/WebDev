Day 1:

Folder was set up and linked to my github repo "https://github.com/falconis/WebDev.git".
The following commands were used:
    1. git remote add WebDev https://github.com/falconis/WebDev.git

/* Ran into a problem here. Actually my proxy was interfering woth github connection. So, I had to unset the environment variables through terminal
 * Commands used:
 *   1. unset HTTP_PROXY
 *   2. unset HTTPS_PROXY
 *   3. unset FTP_PROXY
 *
 * This turned out to be a temporary fix. Values were resetting after opening a new session. */
